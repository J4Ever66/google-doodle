The greatest inventor to ever live thus far. Constantly oppressed by the constrictive society around him, we would not be where we are today without him. A genius that was able to harness the free energy we constantly have at our disposal. Nikola Tesla invented countless priceless inventions including, the lightbulb, AC electricity, wireless electricity, tesla coils, AC motors, radios. The death ray is one of many inventions Tesla would never allow to fall into the hands of the unworthy. The CIA raided Tesla's laboratory numerous times, confiscating and destroying his inventions. I often wonder what the world would be like if he had been able to achieve his dreams, a world where everyone has free, unlimited energy. He will not be forgotten, neither will his dreams and asperations.
